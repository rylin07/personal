            <h1>Ryan Lin</h1>
            <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; color: brown">Software Engineer</p>
            <p>I am currently a junior majoring in Software Engineer at Iowa State University. 
                Some of my hobbies include experimenting with hardware such as constructing and 
                deconstructing pcs as well as playing video games. My plans in the future are to
                graduate and move to New York with my wife and settle there for a few years while
                she completes her med school degree. </p>

                <h3>Project 1</h3>
                <p>The first project is related to develop a single Web page using only two technologies: HTML and CSS. 
                    The project consists on creating a single web page with a menu at the top know as Navitation Bar. 
                    We have to include text describing ourself and text describing the project. Additionally, we need to include two images: 
                    one image is of ourself and second image is anything related to the project itself.</p>

                <h3>Project 2</h3>
                <p>This is a project called NoteSync that I was apart in with a team of 4 in ComS309. 
                    Our project  is an app that aims to allow students to create, share, and edit notes in real time.
                    Some features included are a directory with folder and document creattion, real time note taking with peers, 
                    and live upload and download of files.
